## PESSTO Groups Introduction[PESSTO Groups Introduction] ##

**The PESSTO Groups' primary function are to act as mailing lists.** So, for instance, if you are a member of the 'All at PESSTO' group you can both:  
	
1. send an email to the whole group by emailing *all(@)pessto.org* and,
2. receive emails sent by other members to *all(@)pessto.org*

The **PESSTO Groups also provide a secondary discussion forum format to both post to the groups and view/search the entire archive of posts made to groups**. To access this discussion forum format you must login with your pessto.org username and password here: [http://goo.gl/8T8fg](http://goo.gl/8T8fg).

#### I have a personal gmail account, do I have to keep signing in and out every time I want to switch accounts?[I have a personal gmail account]

No. Google allows multiple signins for the same browser. You can 'add an account' to make it very easy to switch between multiple accounts. First select 'Add Account',

![Select 'add account'](images/dave.young_screengrab_2012_04_19_at_17.07.39.png) 

Then from another google account all you have to do to switch into your peesto.org account is to select it from the drop down account selection at the top right of any google product page.

#### I'm a PESSTO member but don't have a pessto.org username and password. How do I get one?[I'm a PESSTO member but]

If you're a PESSTO member but do not have a pessto.org username you can request one by emailing Dave Young (<d.r.young(@)qub.ac.uk>). When requesting a username please give your full name, affiliation email address and affiliation title in this format:

> jayne.doe \<j.doe@university.ac.uk> (My University)

<br>
#### Is my pessto.org account *another* email account that I have to manage?[Is my pessto.org account another email account]

No. Your pessto.org username (e.g. jayne.doe@pessto.org) is simply the username used to sign in to the online discussion forums for these PESSTO groups. To post to the group via email, simply use your normal affiliation email address.

<br>
#### What happened to the old ESO-PUBSPEC(@)jiscmail.ac.uk mailing list?[What happened to the old ESO-PUBSPEC]

This has now been replaced by the 'All at PESSTO' group. This group can be posted to by sending email to <all(@)pessto.org> from your affiliation email address (e.g. d.r.young(@)qub.ac.uk) 

<br>
#### I'm not receiving posts via email from any group besides all(@)pessto.org, why not?[I'm not receiving posts via email from any]

The groups have been setup this way by default so that you're not spammed by hundreds of emails you're not interested in. If you wish to receive posts via email for a specific group then send a request to Dave Young (<d.r.young(@)qub.ac.uk>) with the subject:

> subscribe to \<*name of list*>
	
and with your details in the body of the email in this format:  

> jayne.doe \<j.doe@university.ac.uk> (My University)
